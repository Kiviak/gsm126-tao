(Directional differentiability does not imply total differentiability). Let $f:\bold R^2\to \bold R$ be defined by setting $f(0,0)\coloneqq 0$ and $f(x_1,x_2)\coloneqq \frac {x_1 x_2^2}{x_1^2+x_2^2}$ for $(x_1,x_2)\in \bold R^2\backslash\{(0,0)\}$. Show that the directional derivatives $D_vf(x)$ exist for all $x,v \in \bold R^2$ (so in particular, the partial derivatives exist), but that $f$ is not totally differentiable at the origin $(0,0)$.
