(Total differentiability implies directional and partial differentiability). Show that if $f:\bold R^d\to \bold R$ is totally differentiable at $x_0$, then it is directionally differentiable at $x_0$ in each direction $v\in \bold R^d$, and one has the formula 
$$D_vf(x_0)=v\cdot \nabla f(x_0)$$
In particular, the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(x_0)$ exist for $i=1,\dots, d$ and $$\nabla f(x_0)=\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(x_0),\dots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_d}(x_0)\right)$$
