(Continuous partial differentiability implies total differentiability). Let $f:\bold R^d\to \bold R$ be such that the partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}:\bold R^d\to \bold R$ exist everywhere and are continuous. Then show that $f$ is totally differentiable everywhere, which in particular, implies that the gradient is given by the formula $(2.3)$ and the directional derivatives are given by $(2.2)$.
