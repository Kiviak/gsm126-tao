(Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, singular continuous case).
1. If $F : \bold R \to \bold R$ is a monotone non-decreasing function, show that $F$ is continuous if and only if $\mu_F(\{x\})=0$ for all $x\in \bold R$.
2. If $F$ is the Cantor function (defined in Exercise 1.6.48), show that $\mu_F$ is a probability measure supported on the middle-thirds Cantor set (see Exercise 1.2.9) in the sense that $\mu_F(\bold R\backslash \mathcal{C})=0$. The measure $\mu_F$ is known as $Cantor\ measure$.
3. If $\mu_F$ is Cantor measure, establish the self-similarity properties $\mu (\frac{1}{3}\cdot E)=\frac{1}{2}\mu(E)$ and $\mu (\frac{1}{3}\cdot E +\frac{2}{3})=\frac{1}{2}\mu(E)$ for every Borel-measurable $E\sub [0,1]$,  where $\frac{1}{3}\cdot E\coloneqq \{\frac{1}{3}x: x\in E\}$.
