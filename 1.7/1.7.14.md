(Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, pure point case).
1. If $H : \bold R \to \bold R$ is the $Heaviside\ function\ H \coloneqq 1_{[0,+\infty)}$, show that $\mu_H$ is equal to the Dirac measure $\delta _0$ at the origin (defined in Example 1.4.22).
2. If $F=\sum _n c_n J_n$ is a jump function (as defined in Definition 1.6.30), show that $\mu_F$ is equal to the linear combination $\sum _nc_n \delta_{x_n}$ of delta functions (as defined in Exercise 1.4.22), where $x_n$ is the point of discontinuity for the basic jump function $J_n$.
