Give an example of a Borel measurable function $f:[0,1]^2 \to \bold R$ such that the integrals $\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dy$ and $\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dx$ exist as absolutely integrable integrals for all $x\in [0,1]$ and $y\in [0,1]$, respectively, and that $\int _{[0,1]} (\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dy)\ dx$ and $\int _{[0,1]} (\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dx)\ dy$ exist and are absolutely integrable, but such that
$$\int _{[0,1]} (\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dy)\ dx \not = \int _{[0,1]} (\int _{[0,1]} f(x,y)\ dx)\ dy$$
are unequal. Thus we see that Fubiniâ€™s theorem fails when one drops the hypothesis that $f$ is absolutely integrable with respect to the product space.
