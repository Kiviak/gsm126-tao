1. Show that the product of two trivial $\sigma$-algebras (on two different spaces $X$, $Y$) is again trivial.
2. Show that the product of two atomic $\sigma$-algebras is again atomic.
3. Show that the product of two finite $\sigma$-algebras is again finite.
4. Show that the product of two Borel $\sigma$-algebras (on two Euclidean spaces $\bold R^d$, $\bold R^{d'}$ with $d,d'\ge 1$) is again the Borel $\sigma$-algebra (on $\bold R^d \times \bold R^{d'}\equiv \bold R^{d+d'}$).
5. Show that the product of two Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebras (on two Euclidean spaces $\bold R^d$, $\bold R^{d'}$ with $d,d'\ge 1$) is not the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra.
6. However, show that the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra on $\bold R^{d+d'}$ is the completion (see Exercise 1.4.26) of the product of the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebras of $\bold R^d$ and $\bold R^{d'}$ with respect to $d+d'$-dimensional Lebesgue measure.
7. This part of the exercise is only for students who are comfortable with cardinal arithmetic. Give an example to show that the product
of two discrete $\sigma$-algebras is not necessarily discrete.
8. On the other hand, show that the product of two discrete $\sigma$-algebras $2^X,2^Y$ is again a discrete $\sigma$-algebra if at least one of the domains $X$, $Y$ is at most  countably infinite.
