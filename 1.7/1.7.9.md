Let $\mu _0 :\mathcal{B} _0 \to [0,+\infty]$ be a pre-measure which is $\sigma$-finite (thus $X$ is the countable union of sets in $\mathcal{B} _0$ of finite $\mu _0$-measure), and let $\mu :\mathcal{B} \to [0,+\infty]$ be the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension of $\mu _0$.
1. Show that if $E \in \mathcal{B}$, then there exists $F \in \lang \mathcal{B}_0\rang$ containing $E$ such that $\mu(F\backslash E)=0$ (thus $F$ consists of the union of $E$ and a null set). Furthermore, show that $F$ can be chosen to be a countable intersection $F=\bigcap _{n=1}^\infty F_n$ of sets $F_n$, each of which is a countable
union $F_n=\bigcap _{m=1}^\infty F_{n,m}$ of sets $F_{n,m}$ in $\mathcal{B} _0$.
2. If $E \in \mathcal{B}$ has finite measure (i.e. $\mu(E)< \infty$), and $\varepsilon>0$, show that there exists $F\in \mathcal{B} _0$ such that $\mu(E\Delta F)\le \varepsilon$.
3. Conversely, if $E$ is a set such that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $F\in \mathcal{B} _0$ such that $\mu^*(E\Delta F)\le \varepsilon$, show that $E \in \mathcal{B}$.
