Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a Boolean algebra on a set $X$. Show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if and only if it is closed under countable disjoint unions, which means that $\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n \in \mathcal{B}$ whenever $E_1, E_2, E_3,\dots \in \mathcal{B}$ are a countable sequence of disjoint sets in $\mathcal{B}$.
