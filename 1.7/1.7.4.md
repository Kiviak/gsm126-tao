1. Show that the requirement that $\mu_0$ is finitely additive can be relaxed to the condition that $\mu_0(\empty) = 0$ without affecting the definition of a pre-measure.
2. Show that the condition $\mu_0(\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\mu_0(E_n)$ can be relaxed to $\mu_0(\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n)\le\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\mu_0(E_n)$ without affecting the definition of a pre-measure.
3. On the other hand, give an example to show that if one performs both of the above two relaxations at once, one starts admitting objects $\mu_0$ that are not pre-measures.
