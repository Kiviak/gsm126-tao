(Integration by parts formula). Let $F,G : \bold R \to \bold R$ be monotone non-decreasing and continuous. Show that 
$$\int _{[a,b]}F\ dG= -\int _{[a,b]}G\ dF +F(b)G(b)-F(a)G(a)$$
for any compact interval $[a,b]$. This formula can be partially extended to the case when one or both of $F,G$ have discontinuities, but care must be taken when $F$ and $G$ are simultaneously discontinuous at the same location.
