Let $(X,\mathcal{B} _X)$ and $(Y,\mathcal{B} _Y)$ be measurable spaces.
1. Show that $\mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the sets $E \times F$ with $E \in \mathcal{B} _X$, $Y\in \mathcal{B} _Y$. In other words, $\mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$ is the coarsest $\sigma$-algebra on $X \times Y$ with the property that the product of a $\mathcal{B} _X$-measurable set and a $\mathcal{B} _Y$-measurable set is always $\mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$ measurable.
2. Show that $\mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$ is the coarsest $\sigma$-algebra on $X \times Y$ that makes the projection maps $\pi_X$, $\pi_Y$ both measurable morphisms (see Remark 1.4.33).
3. If $E \in \mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$, show that the sets $E_x \coloneqq \{y \in Y: (x,y) \in E\}$ lie in $\mathcal{B} _Y$ for every $x\in X$, and similarly that the sets $E_y \coloneqq \{x \in X: (x,y) \in E\}$ lie in $\mathcal{B} _X$ for every $ y \in Y$.
4. If $f: X \times Y \to [0,+\infty]$ is measurable (with respect to $\mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$), show that the function $f_x : y \mapsto f(x,y)$ is $\mathcal{B} _Y$-measurable for every $x\in X$, and similarly that the function $f_y : x \mapsto f(x,y)$ is $\mathcal{B} _X$-measurable for every $ y \in Y$.
5. If $E \in \mathcal{B} _X \times \mathcal{B} _Y$, show that the slices $E_x \coloneqq \{y\in Y: (x,y)\in E\}$ lie in a countably generated $\sigma$-algebra. In other words, show that there exists an at most countable collection $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A} _E$ of sets (which can depend on $E$) such that $\{E_x: x\in X\}\sub \lang\mathcal{A}\rang$. Conclude, in particular, that the number of distinct slices $E_x$ is at most $c$, the cardinality of the continuum. (The last part of this exercise is only suitable for students who are comfortable with cardinal arithmetic.)
