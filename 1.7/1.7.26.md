(Approximations to the identity). Let $P: \bold R^d \to \bold R^+$ be a good kernel (see Exercise 1.6.27), and let $P_t(x) \coloneqq \frac{1}{t^d} P(\frac{x}{t}) $ be the associated rescaled functions. Show that if $f:\bold R^d \to \bold C$ is absolutely integrable, that $f*P_t$ converges in $L^1$ norm to $f$ as $t\to 0$.
