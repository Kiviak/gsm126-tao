Define a $Radon\ measure$ on $\bold R$ to be a Borel measure $\mu$ obeying the following additional properties:
1. (Local finiteness) $\mu(K)<\infty$ for every compact $K$.
2. (Inner regularity) One has $\mu(E)=\sup _{K\sub E,\ K\ \text{compact}}\mu(K)$ for every Borel set $E$.
3. (Outer regularity) One has $\mu(E)=\inf _{U\supset E,\ U\ \text{open}}\mu(U)$ for every Borel set $E$.

Show that for every monotone function $F:\bold R \to \bold R$, the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure $\mu_ F$ is a Radon measure on $\bold R$; conversely, if $\mu$ is a Radon measure on $\bold R$, show that there exists a monotone function $F:\bold R \to \bold R$ such that $\mu=\mu_ F$.
