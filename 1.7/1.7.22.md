The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate that Tonelliâ€™s theorem can fail if the $\sigma$-finite hypothesis is removed, and also that product measure need not be unique. Let $X$ is the unit interval $[0,1]$ with Lebesgue measure $m$ (and the Lebesgue $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{L}([0,1])$) and $Y$ is the unit interval $[0,1]$ with counting measure (and the discrete $\sigma$-algebra $2 ^{[0,1]}$) $\#$. Let $f\coloneqq 1_E$ be the indicator function of the diagonal $E\coloneqq \{(x,x):x\in [0,1]\}$.
1. Show that $f$ is measurable in the product $\sigma$-algebra.
2. Show that $\int _X (\int _Y f(x,y)\ d\#(y)) \ dm(x)=1$.
3. Show that $\int _X (\int _Y f(x,y)\ dm(x)) \ d\#(y)=0$.
4. Show that there is more than one measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{L}([0,1])\times 2 ^{[0,1]}$ with the property that $\mu(E\times F)=m(E)\#(F)$ for all $E\sub \mathcal{L}([0,1])$ and $F\in 2 ^{[0,1]}$.
