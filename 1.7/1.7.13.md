(Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure, absolutely continuous case).
1. If $F : \bold R \to \bold R$ is the identity function $F(x)=x$, show that $\mu _F$ is equal to Lebesgue measure $m$.
2. If $F : \bold R \to \bold R$ is monotone non-decreasing and absolutely continuous (which, in particular, implies that $F'$ exists and is absolutely integrable), show that $\mu _F=m _{F'}$ in the sense of Exercise 1.4.48, thus $$\mu _F(E)=\int _E F'(x)\ dx$$ for any Borel measurable $E$, and $$\int _{\bold R} f(x)\ d\mu _F(x)=\int _{\bold R} f(x)F'(x)\ dx$$ for any unsigned Borel measurable $f : \bold R \to [0,+\infty]$.
