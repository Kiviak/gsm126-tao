The purpose of this exercise is to show that the $\sigma$-finite hypothesis in Exercise 1.7.7 cannot be removed. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the collection of all subsets in $\bold R$ that can be expressed as finite unions of half-open intervals $[a,b)$. Let $\mu_0 :\mathcal{A} \to [0,+\infty]$ be the function such that $\mu_0(E)=+\infty$ for non-empty $E$ and $\mu _0 (\empty)=0$.
1. Show that $\mu_0$ is a pre-measure.
2. Show that $\lang\mathcal{A}\rang$ is the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}[\bold R]$.
3. Show that the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension $\mu :\mathcal{B}[\bold R] \to [0,+\infty]$ of $\mu_0$ assigns an infinite measure to any non-empty Borel set.
4. Show that counting measure $\#$ (or more generally, $c\#$ for any $c\in (0,+\infty]$) is another extension of $\mu_0$ on $\mathcal{B}[\bold R]$.
