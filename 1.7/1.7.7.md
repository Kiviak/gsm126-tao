Let $\mu _0 :\mathcal{B} _0 \to [0,+\infty]$ be a pre-measure, let $\mu :\mathcal{B} \to [0,+\infty]$ be the Hahn-Kolmogorov extension of $\mu _0$, and let $\mu' :\mathcal{B}' \to [0,+\infty]$ be another countably additive extension of $\mu _0$. Suppose also that $\mu _0$ is $\sigma$-finite, which means that one can express the whole space $X$ as the countable union of sets $E_1,E_2,\dots \in\mathcal{B} _0$ for which $\mu _0 (E_n)<\infty$ for all $n$. Show that $\mu$ and $\mu'$ agree on their common domain of definition. In other words, show that $\mu(E)=\mu'(E) $ for all $E \in \mathcal{B}\cap \mathcal{B}'$.
