Let $E,F\sub \bold R^d$ be Jordan measurable sets.
1. (Boolean closure) Show that $E\cup F$, $E\cap F$, $E\backslash F$, and $E\Delta F$ are Jordan measurable.
2. (Non-negativity) $m(E)\ge 0$.
3. (Finite additivity) If $E,F$ are disjoint, then $m(E\cup F)=m(E)+m(F)$.
4. (Monotonicity) If $E\sub F$, then $m(E)\le m(F)$.
5. (Finite subadditivity) $m(E\cup F)\le m(E)+m(F)$.
6. (Translation invariance) For any $x\in\bold R^d$, $E+x$ is Jordan measurable, and $m(E+x)=m(E)$.
