(Uniqueness of elementary measure). Let $d \ge 1$. Let $m': {\Large \varepsilon} (\bold R^d) \to \bold R^+$ be a map from the collection ${\Large \varepsilon} (\bold R^d)$ of  elementary subsets of $\bold R^d$ to the non-negative reals that obeys the non-negativity, finite additivity, and translation invariance properties. Show that there exists a constant $c \in \bold R^+$ such that $m'(E) = c \cdot m(E)$ for all elementary sets $E$. In particular, if we impose the additional normalisation $m'([0, 1)^d) = 1$, then $m' \equiv m$.
