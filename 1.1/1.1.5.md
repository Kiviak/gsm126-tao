(Characterisation of Jordan measurability). Let $E \sub \bold R^d$ be bounded. Show that the following are equivalent:
1. $E$ is Jordan measurable.
2. For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exist elementary sets $A \sub E \sub B$ such that $m(B \backslash A) \le \varepsilon$.
3. For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an elementary set $A$ such that
$m^{*,(J)}(A \Delta E) \le \varepsilon$.
