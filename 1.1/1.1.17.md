Let $P, Q$ be two polytopes in $ \bold R^d$. Suppose that $P$ can be partitioned into finitely many sub-polytopes $P_1, \dots ,P_n$ which, after being rotated and translated, form new polytopes $Q_1, \dots ,Q_n$ which are an $almost\ disjoint\ cover$ of $Q$, which means that $Q = Q_1 \cup \dots \cup Q_n$, and for any $1 \le i<j \le n$, $Q_i$ and $Q_j$ only intersect at the boundary (i.e. the interior of $Q_i$ is disjoint from the interior of $Q_j$ ). Conclude that $P$ and $Q$ have the same Jordan measure. The converse statement is true in one and two dimensions $d = 1, 2$ (this is the $Bolyai-Gerwien\ theorem$), but false in higher dimensions (this was Dehn's negative answer [**De1901**] to $Hilbert's\ third\ problem$).
