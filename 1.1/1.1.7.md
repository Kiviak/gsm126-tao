(Regions under graphs are Jordan measurable). Let $B$ be a closed box in $\bold R^d$, and let $f:B\to \bold R$ be a continuous function.
1. Show that the graph $\{(x,f(x)):\ x\in B\}\sub \bold R^{d+1}$ is Jordan measurable in $\bold R^{d+1}$ with Jordan measure zero.
2. Show that the set $\{(x,t):\ x\in B;\ 0 \le t \le f(x)\} \sub \bold R^{d+1}$ is Jordan measurable.
