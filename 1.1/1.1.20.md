(Piecewise constant functions). Let $[a,b]$ be an interval. A $piecewise\ constant\ function\ f:[a,b]\to\bold R$ is a function for which there exists a partition of $[a,b]$ into finitely many intervals $I_1,\dots,I_n$, such that $f$ is equal to a constant $c_i$ on each of the intervals $I_i$. If $f$ is piecewise constant, show that the expression 
$$\sum \limits _{i=1}^{n}c_i|I_i|$$
is independent of the choice of partition used to demonstrate the piecewise constant nature of $f$. We will denote this quantity by $\text{p.c.}\int _a^b f(x)\ dx$, and refer to it as the $piecewise\ constant\ integral$ of $f$ on $[a,b]$.
