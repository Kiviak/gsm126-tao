Let $E \sub \bold R^d$ be a bounded set.
1. Show that $E$ and the closure $\overline{E}$ of $E$ have the same Jordan outer measure.
2. Show that $E$ and the interior $E^{\circ}$ of $E$ have the same Jordan inner measure.
3. Show that $E$ is Jordan measurable if and only if the topological boundary $\partial E$ of $E$ has Jordan outer measure zero.
4. Show that the $bullet-riddled\ square$ ${[0, 1]^2 \backslash {\bold Q^2}}$, and set of bullets ${[0, 1]^2 \cap {\bold Q^2}}$, both have Jordan inner measure zero and Jordan outer measure one. In particular, both sets are not Jordan measurable.
