This exercise assumes familiarity with linear algebra. Let $L:\bold R^d \to \bold R^d$ be a linear transformation.
1. Show that there exists a non-negative real number $D$ such that $m(L(E))=Dm(E)$ for every elementary set $E$ (note from previous exercises that $L(E)$ is Jordan measurable).
2. Show that if $E$ is Jordan measurable, then $L(E)$ is also, and $m(L(E))=Dm(E)$.
3. Show that $D=|\det L|$.
