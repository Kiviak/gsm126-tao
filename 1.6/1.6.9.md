A $homomorphism\ f:\bold R^d \to \bold C$ is a map with the property that $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$ for all $x,y \in \bold R^d$.
1. Show that all measurable homomorphisms are continuous. 
2. Show that $f$ is a measurable homomorphism if and only if it takes the form $f(x_1,\dots,x_d)= x_1 z_1+\dots + x_d z_d$ for all $x_1,\dots,x_d \in \bold R$ and some complex coefficients $z_1,\dots,z_d$.
3. (For readers familiar with $Zornâ€™s\ lemma$, see $\S 2.4$ of $An\ epsilon\ of\ room, \text{Vol}.\ I$.) Show that there exist homomorphisms $f:\bold R^d \to \bold C$ which are not of the form in the previous exercise. This gives an alternate construction of a non-measurable set to that given in previous notes.
