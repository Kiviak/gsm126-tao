Let $f:\bold R^d \to \bold C$, $g:\bold R^d \to \bold C$ be Lebesgue measurable functions such that $f$ is absolutely integrable and $g$ is essentially bounded (i.e. bounded outside of a null set). Show that the convolution $f*g:\bold R^d \to \bold C$ defined by the formula
$$f*g(x)= \int _{\bold R^d} f(y)g(x-y)\ dy$$
is well defined (in the sense that the integrand on the right-hand side is absolutely integrable) and that $f*g$ is a bounded, continuous function.
