A function $f:\bold R\to \bold R$ is said to be $convex$ if one has $f((1-t)x+ty)\le (1-t)f(x)+t f(y)$ for all $x<y$ and $0<t<1$. Show that if $f$ is convex, then it is continuous and almost everywhere differentiable, and its derivative $f'$ is equal almost everywhere to a monotone non-decreasing function, and so is itself almost everywhere differentiable. Thus we see that in some sense, convex functions are $\text{\textquotedblleft almost everywhere twice differentiable \textquotedblright}$. Similar claims also hold for concave functions, of course.
