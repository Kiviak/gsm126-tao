(Lipschitz differentiation theorem, one-dimensional case). A function $f:\bold R\to \bold R$ is said to be $Lipschitz\ continuous$ if there exists a constant $C>0$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)|\le C |x-y|$ for all $x,y \in \bold R$; the smallest $C$ with this property is known as the Lipschitz constant of $f$. Show that every Lipschitz continuous function $F$ is locally of bounded variation, and hence differentiable almost everywhere. Furthermore, show that the derivative $F'$, when it exists, is bounded in magnitude by the Lipschitz constant of $F$.
