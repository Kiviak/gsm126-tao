(Cousin’s theorem). Prove $Cousin’s\ theorem$: given any function $\delta :[a,b] \to (0,+\infty)$ on a compact interval $[a,b]$ of positive length, there exists a partition $a=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_k=b$ with $k\ge 1$, together with real numbers $t_j^*\in [t_{j-1} ,t_j]$ for each $1\le j \le k$ and $t_j - t_{j-1}< \delta(t_j^*)$. This theorem is useful in a variety of applications related to the second fundamental theorem of calculus, as we shall see below. The positive function $\delta$ is known as a $gauge\ function$.
