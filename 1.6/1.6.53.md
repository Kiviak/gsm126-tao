Let $F:[-1,1]\to \bold R$ be the function defined by setting $F(x)\coloneqq x^2 \sin (\frac{1}{x^3})$ when $x$ is non-zero, and $F(0)\coloneqq 0$. Show that $F$ is everywhere differentiable, but the deriative $F'$ is not absolutely integrable, and so the second fundamental theorem of calculus does not apply in this case (at least if we interpret $\int _{[a,b]} F'(x)\ dx$ using the absolutely convergent Lebesgue integral). See, however, the next exercise.
