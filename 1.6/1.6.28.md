(Weierstrass function). Let $F : \bold R \to \bold R$ be the function 
$$F(x)\coloneqq \sum _{n=1}^{\infty}4^{-n}\sin(8^n\pi x)$$  
1. Show that $F$ is well defined (in the sense that the series is absolutely convergent) and that $F$ is a bounded continuous function.
2. Show that for every 8-dyadic interval $[{j\over 8^n},{{j+1}\over 8^n}]$ with $n \ge 1$, one has $|F({{j+1}\over 8^n})-F({{j}\over 8^n})| \ge c4^{-n}$ for some absolute constant $c > 0$.
3. Show that $F$ is not differentiable at any point $x \in\bold R$. ($Hint$: Argue by contradiction and use the previous part of this exercise.)  Note that it is not enough to formally differentiate the series term by term and observe that the resulting series is divergent $\text{---Why not?}$
