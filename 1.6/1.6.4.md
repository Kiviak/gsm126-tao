(Uniqueness of antiderivatives up to constants). Let $[a, b]$ be a compact interval of positive length, and let $F : [a, b] \to \bold R$ and $G : [a, b] \to \bold R$ be differentiable functions. Show that $F'(x) = G'(x)$ for every $x \in [a, b]$ if and only if $F(x) = G(x) + C$ for some constant $C \in\bold R$ and all $x \in [a,b]$.
