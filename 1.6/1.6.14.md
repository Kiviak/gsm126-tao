Call a function $f:\bold R^d \to \bold C$  $locally\ integrable$ if, for every $x \in \bold R^d$, there exists an open neighbourhood of $x$ on which $f$ is absolutely integrable.
1. Show that $f$ is locally integrable if and only if $\int _{B(0,r)} |f(x)|\ dx <\infty$ for all $r > 0$.
2. Show that Theorem 1.6.19 implies a generalisation of itself in which the condition of absolute integrability of $f$ is weakened to local integrability.
