(Besicovitch covering lemma in one dimension). Let $I_1,\dots,I_n$ be a finite family of open intervals in $\bold R$ (not necessarily disjoint). Show that there exist a subfamily $I'_1,\dots,I'_m$ of intervals such that:
1. $\bigcup _{i=1}^n I_i=\bigcup _{j=1}^m I'_j$
2. Each point $x \in\bold R$ is contained in at most two of the $I'_j$.
