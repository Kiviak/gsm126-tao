Give an example to show that Rolle's theorem can fail if $f$ is merely assumed to be almost everywhere differentiable, even if one adds the additional hypothesis that $f$ is continuous. This example illustrates that everywhere differentiability is a significantly stronger property than almost everywhere differentiability. We will see further evidence of this fact later in these notes; there are many theorems that assert in their conclusion that a function is almost everywhere differentiable, but few that manage to conclude everywhere differentiability.
