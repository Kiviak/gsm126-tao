(Cantor function). Define the functions $F_0,F_1,F_2,\dots:[0,1]\to \bold R$ recursively as follows:
- Set $F_0(x)\coloneqq x$ for all $x\in [0,1]$.
- For each $n=1,2,\dots$ in turn, define
$F_n(x) \coloneqq \begin{cases}
   {1 \over 2}F_{n-1}(3x) &\text{if } x \in [0,1/3] \\
   {1 \over 2} &\text{if } x \in (1/3,2/3) \\
   {1 \over 2}+{1 \over 2}F_{n-1}(3x-2) &\text{if } x \in [2/3,1]
\end{cases}$
1. Graph $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ (preferably on a single graph).
2. Show that for each $n=0,1,\dots$, $F_n$ is a continuous monotone non-decreasing function with $F_n(0)=0$ and $F_n(1)=1$.
3. Show that for each $n=0,1,\dots$, one has $|F_{n+1}(x)-F_n(x)|\le 2^{-n}$ for each $x\in [0,1]$. Conclude that the $F_n$ converge uniformly to a limit $F:[0,1]\to \bold R$. This limit is known as the $Cantor\ function$.
4. Show that the Cantor function $F$ is continuous and monotone non-decreasing, with $F(0)=0$ and $F(1)=1$.
5. Show that if $x\in [0,1]$ lies outside the middle thirds Cantor set (Exercise 1.2.9), then $F$ is constant in a neighbourhood of $x$, and in particular, $F'(x)=0$. Conclude that $\int _{[0,1]}F'(x)\ dx=0 \not =1=F(1)-F(0)$, so that the second fundamental theorem of calculus fails for this function.
6. Show that $F(\sum _{n=1}^\infty a_n 3^{-n})=\sum _{n=1}^\infty {a_n \over 2}2^{-n}$ for any digits $a_1,a_2,\dots \in \{0,2\}$. Thus the Cantor function, in some sense, converts base three expansions to base two expansions.
7. Let $I=[\sum _{i=1}^n {a_i \over 3^i},\sum _{i=1}^n {a_i \over 3^i}+{1 \over 3^n}]$ be one of the intervals used in the $n^{th}$ cover $I_n$ of $C$ (see Exercise 1.2.9), thus $n\ge 0$ and $a_1,\dots,a_n \in \{0,2\}$. Show that $I$ is an interval of length $3^{-n}$, but $F(I)$ is an interval of length $2^{-n}$.
8. Show that $F$ is not differentiable at any element of the Cantor set $C$.
