If $F : [a, b] \to \bold R$ is everywhere differentiable, show that $F$ is continuous and $F'$ is measurable. If $F$ is almost everywhere differentiable, show that the (almost everywhere defined) function $F'$ is measurable (i.e. it is equal to an everywhere defined measurable function on $[a, b]$ outside of a null set), but give an example to demonstrate that $F$ need not be continuous.
