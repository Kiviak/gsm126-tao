Let $E \sub\bold R^d$ be a measurable set of positive measure, and let $\varepsilon>0$.
1. Using Exercise 1.6.15 and Exercise 1.6.24, show that there exists a cube $Q \sub\bold R^d$ of positive sidelength such that $m(E\cap Q)>(1-\varepsilon)m(Q)$.
2. Give an alternate proof of the above claim that avoids the Lebesgue differentiation theorem.
3. Use the above result to give an alternate proof of the Steinhaus theorem (Exercise 1.6.8).
