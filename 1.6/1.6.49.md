1. Show that every absolutely continuous function is uniformly continuous and therefore continuous.
2. Show that every absolutely continuous function is of bounded variation on every compact interval $[a, b]$. In particular (by Exercise 1.6.41), absolutely continuous functions are differentiable almost everywhere.
3. Show that every Lipschitz continuous function is absolutely continuous.
4. Show that the function $x \mapsto \sqrt{x}$ is absolutely continuous, but not Lipschitz continuous, on the interval $[0, 1]$.
5. Show that the Cantor function from Exercise 1.6.48 is continuous, monotone, and uniformly continuous, but not absolutely continuous, on $[0, 1]$.
6. If $f :\bold R \to\bold R$ is absolutely integrable, show that the indefinite integral $F(x)\coloneqq \int _{[-\infty,x]}f(y)\ dy$ is absolutely continuous, and that $F$ is differentiable almost everywhere with $F'(x) = f(x)$ for almost every $x$.
7. Show that the sum or product of two absolutely continuous functions on an interval $[a, b]$ remains absolutely continuous. What happens if we work on $\bold R$ instead of on $[a, b]$?
