(Compatibility of the strong and weak derivatives in the absolutely continuous case). Let $F:[a,b]\to \bold R$ be an absolutely continuous function, and let $\phi:[a,b]\to \bold R$ be a continuously differentiable function supported in a compact subset of $(a,b)$. Show that $\int _{[a,b]} F'\phi(x)\ dx =-\int _{[a,b]} F\phi'(x)\ dx$.
