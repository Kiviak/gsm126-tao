(Approximations to the identity). Define a $good\ kernel$ to be a measurable function $P:\bold R^d\to \bold R^+$ which is non-negative, radial (which means that there is a function $\tilde{P}:[0,+\infty) \to \bold R^+$ such that $P(x)=\tilde{P}(|x|)$, radially non-increasing (so that $\tilde{P}$ is a non-increasing function), and has total mass $\int _{\bold R^d}P(x)\ dx$ equal to $1$. The functions $P_t(x)\coloneqq \frac{1}{t^d}P(\frac{x}{t})$ for $t>0$ are then said to be a $good\ family\ of\ approximations\ to\ the\ identity$.
1. Show that the $heat\ kernels\ P_t(x)\coloneqq \frac{1}{(4\pi t^2)^{d/2}}e^{-|x|^2/4t^2}$ and $Poisson\ kernels\ P_t(x)\coloneqq c_d\frac{t}{(t^2+|x|^2)^{(d+1)/2}}$ are good families of approximations to the identity, if the constant $c_d>0$ is chosen correctly (in fact one has $c_d=\varGamma((d+1)/2)/\pi ^{(d+1)/2}$, but you are not required to establish this).
2. Show that if $P$ is a good kernel, then $$c_d<\sum _{n=-\infty}^\infty 2^{dn}\tilde{P}(2^n) \le C_d$$
for some constants $0< c_d <C_d$ depending only on $d$.
3. Establish the quantitative upper bound $$|\int _{\bold R^d}f(y)P_t(x-y)\ dy|\le C'_d \sup _{r>0}\frac {1}{|B(x,r)|}\int _{B(x,r)}|f(y)|\ dy$$ for any absolutely integrable function $f$ and some constant $C'_d>0$ depending only on $d$.
4. Show that if $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is absolutely integrable and $x$ is a Lebesgue point of $f$, then the convolution $$f*P_t(x)\coloneqq \int _{\bold R^d}f(y)P_t(x-y)\ dy$$ converges to $f(x)$ as $t\to 0$. In particular, $f*P_t$ converges pointwise almost
everywhere to $f$.
