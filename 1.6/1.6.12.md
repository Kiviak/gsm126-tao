(Rising sun inequality). Let $f:\bold R \to \bold R$ be an absolutely integrable function, and let $f^*:\bold R \to \bold R$ be the one-sided signed Hardy-Littlewood maximal function
$$f^*(x)\coloneqq \sup _{h>0}\frac{1}{h} \int _{[x,x+h]} f(t)\ dt$$
Establish the $rising\ sun\ inequality$ 
$$\lambda m(\{x\in \bold R: f^*(x)>\lambda\})\le \int _{x:f^*(x)>\lambda} f(x)\ dx$$
for all real $\lambda$ (note here that we permit $\lambda$ to be zero or negative), and show that this inequality implies Lemma 1.6.16. See [**Ta2009**, $\S 2.9$] for some further discussion of inequalities of this type, and applications to ergodic theory (and in particular, the $maximal\ ergodic$ theorem).
