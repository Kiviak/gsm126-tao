Let $\mu$ be a Borel measure (i.e., a countably additive measure on the Borel $\sigma$-algebra) on $\bold R$, such that $0 < \mu(I) < \infty$ for every interval $I$ of positive finite length. Assume that $\mu$ is $inner\ regular$, in the sense that $\mu(E) = \sup _{K\sub E,\ K\ \text{compact}}\mu(K)$ for every Borel measurable set $E$. (As it turns out, from the theory of $Radon\ measures$, all locally finite Borel measures have this property, but we will not prove this here; see $\S 1.10$ of $An\ epsilon\ of\ room, \text{Vol}. I$.) Establish the Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality $$\mu(\lbrace x\in\bold R:\sup _{x\in I}{1\over\mu(I)}\int _I |f(y)|\ d\mu(y)\ge \lambda \rbrace)\le {2\over\lambda}\int _{\bold R} |f(y)|\ d\mu(y)$$ 
for any absolutely integrable function $f \in L^1(\mu)$, where the supremum ranges over all open intervals $I$ that contain $x$. Note that this essentially generalises Exercise 1.6.11, in which $\mu$ is replaced by Lebesgue measure. (Hint: Repeat the proof of the usual Hardy-Littlewood maximal inequality, but use the Besicovitch covering lemma in place of the Vitali-type covering lemma. Why do we need the former lemma here instead of the latter?)
