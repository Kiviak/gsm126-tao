1. Show that every function $f:\bold R \to \bold R$ of bounded variation is bounded, and that the limits $\lim _{x\to +\infty} f(x)$ and $\lim _{x\to -\infty} f(x)$, are well defined.
2. Give a counterexample of a bounded, continuous, compactly supported function $f$ that is not of bounded variation.
