For each $h > 0$, let $E_h$ be a subset of $B(0, h)$ with the property that $m(E_h) \ge c\cdot m(B(0, h))$ for some $c > 0$ independent of $h$. Show that if $f : \bold R^d \to\bold C$ is locally integrable, and $x$ is a Lebesgue point of $f$, then
$$\lim _{h\to0}{1\over {m(E_h)}}\int _{x+E_h}f(y)\ dy=f(x)$$
Conclude that Theorem 1.6.19 implies Theorem 1.6.12.
