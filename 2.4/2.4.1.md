Let $((X_\alpha,\mathcal{B}_\alpha))_{\alpha\in A}$ be a family of measurable spaces. For any $B\sub A$, write $\mathcal{B}_B\coloneqq \prod _{\beta\in B} \mathcal{B}_\beta$.
1. Show that $\mathcal{B}_A$ is the coarsest $\sigma$-algebra on $X_A$ that makes the projection maps $\pi _\beta$ measurable morphisms for all $\beta \in A$.
2. Show that for each $B\sub A$, that $\pi _B$ is a measurable morphism from $(X_A,\mathcal{B}_A)$ to $(X_B,\mathcal{B}_B)$.
3. If $E_A$ in $\mathcal{B}_A$, show that there exists an at most countable set $B\sub A$ and a set $E_B\in \mathcal{B}_B$ such that $E_A=\pi_B^{-1}(E_B)$. Informally, this asserts that a measurable event can only depend on at most countably many of the coefficients.
4. If $f:X_A\to [0,+\infty]$ is $\mathcal{B}_A$-measurable, show that there exists an at most countable set $B\sub A$ and a $\mathcal{B}_B$-measurable function $f_B:X_B\to [0,+\infty]$ such that $f=f_B\circ\pi_B$.
5. If $A$ is at most countable, show that $\mathcal{B}_A$ is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the sets $\prod _{\beta\in A}E_\beta$ with $E_\beta\in\mathcal{B}_\beta$ for all $\beta\in A$.
6. On the other hand, show that if $A$ is uncountable and the $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ are all non-trivial, show that $\mathcal{B}_A$ is not the $\sigma$-algebra generated by sets $\prod _{\beta\in A}E_\beta$ with $E_\beta\in\mathcal{B}_\beta$ for all $\beta\in A$.
7. If $B\sub A,\ E\in \mathcal{B}_A$, and $x_{A\backslash B}\in X_{A\backslash B}$, show that the set $E_{x_{A\backslash B},\ B}\coloneqq\{x_B\in X_B:(x_B,x_{A\backslash B})\in E\}$ lies in $\mathcal{B}_B$, where we identify $X_B\times X_{A\backslash B}$ with $X_A$ in the obvious manner.
8. If $B\sub A,\ f:X_A\to [0,+\infty]$ is $\mathcal{B}_A$-measurable, and $x_{A\backslash B}\in X_{A\backslash B}$, show that the function $f_{x_{A\backslash B},\ B}:x_B\mapsto f(x_B,x_{A\backslash B})$ is $\mathcal{B}_B$-measurable.
