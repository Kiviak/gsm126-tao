(Intersection of algebras). Let $(\mathcal{B}_\alpha)_{\alpha\in I}$ be a family of Boolean algebras on a set $X$, indexed by a (possibly infinite or uncountable) label set $I$. Show that the intersection $\bigwedge _{\alpha\in I}\mathcal{B}_\alpha\coloneqq \bigcap _{\alpha\in I}\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ of these algebras is still a Boolean algebra, and is the finest Boolean algebra that is coarser than all $\mathcal{B}_\alpha$. (If $I$ is empty, we adopt the convention that $\bigwedge _{\alpha\in I}\mathcal{B}_\alpha$ is the discrete algebra.)
