(Elementary algebra). Let $\overline{{\large\varepsilon}[\bold R^d]}$ be the collection of those sets $E \sub \bold R^d$ that are either elementary sets, or co-elementary sets (i.e. the complement of an elementary set). Show that $\overline{{\large\varepsilon}[\bold R^d]}$ is a Boolean algebra. We will call this algebra the $elementary\ Boolean\ algebra$ of $\bold R^d$.
