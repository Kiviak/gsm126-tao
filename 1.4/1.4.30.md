Let $(X,\mathcal{B})$ be a measurable space that is atomic, thus $\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{A}((A_\alpha)_{\alpha\in I})$ for some partition $X=\bigcup _{\alpha\in I} A_\alpha$ of $X$ into disjoint nonempty atoms. Show that a function $f:X\to [0,+\infty]$ or $f:X\to \bold C$ is measurable if and only if it is constant on each atom, or equivalently if one has a representation of the form 
$$f=\sum _{\alpha\in I}c_\alpha 1_{A_\alpha}$$ 
for some constants $c_\alpha$ in $[0,+\infty]$ or in $\bold C$ as appropriate. Furthermore, the $c_\alpha$ are uniquely determined by $f$.
