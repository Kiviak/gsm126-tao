(Completion). Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space. Show that there exists a unique refinement $(X,\overline {\mathcal{B}},\overline \mu)$, known as the $completion$ of $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$, which is the coarsest refinement of $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ that is complete. Furthermore, show that $\mathcal{B}$ consists precisely of those sets that differ from a $\mathcal{B}$-measurable set by a $\mathcal{B}$-subnull set.
