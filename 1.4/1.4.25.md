Let $X$ be an at most countable set with the discrete $\sigma$-algebra. Show that every measure $\mu$ on this measurable space can be uniquely represented in the form 
$$\mu=\sum \limits _{x\in X}c_x \delta _x$$
for some $c_x\in [0,+\infty]$, thus 
$$\mu(E)=\sum \limits _{x\in E}c_x$$
for all $E\sub X$. (This claim fails in the uncountable case, although showing this is slightly tricky.)
