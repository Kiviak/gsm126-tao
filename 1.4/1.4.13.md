(Intersection of $\sigma$-algebras). Show that the intersection $\bigwedge _{\alpha\in I} \mathcal{B} _\alpha \coloneqq \bigcap _{\alpha\in I}\mathcal{B} _\alpha$ of an arbitrary (and possibly infinite or uncountable) number of $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal{B} _\alpha$ is again a $\sigma$-algebra, and is the finest $\sigma$-algebra that is coarser than all of the $\mathcal{B} _\alpha$.
