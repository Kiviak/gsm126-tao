(Recursive description of a generated $\sigma$-algebra). (This exercise requires familiarity with the theory of $ordinals$, which is reviewed in $\S 2.4$ of $An\ epsilon\ of\ room,\ \text{Vol}.\ I$. Recall that we are assuming the axiom of choice throughout this text.) Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a collection of sets in a set $X$, and let $\omega _1$ be the first uncountable ordinal. Define the sets $\mathcal{F}_\alpha$ for every countable ordinal $\alpha\in \omega _1$ via transfinite induction as follows:
1. $\mathcal{F}_\alpha\coloneqq\mathcal{F}$.
2. For each countable successor ordinal $\alpha=\beta+1$, we define $\mathcal{F}_\alpha$ to be the collection of all sets that either the union of an at most countable number of sets in $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ (including the empty union $\empty$), or the complement of such a union.
3. For each countable limit ordinal $\alpha=\sup _{\beta<\alpha}\beta$, we define $\mathcal{F}_\alpha\coloneqq \bigcup _{\beta<\alpha}\mathcal{F}_\beta$.

Show that $\langle \mathcal{F} \rangle=\bigcup _{\alpha\in \omega _1}\mathcal{F}_\alpha$.
