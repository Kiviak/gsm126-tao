(Almost dominated convergence). Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f_1,f_2,\dots :X\to \bold C$ be a sequence of measurable functions that converge pointwise $\mu$-almost everywhere to a measurable limit $f : X\to \bold C$. Suppose that there is an unsigned absolutely integrable function $G,g_1,g_2,\dots :X\to [0,+\infty]$ such that the $|f_n|$ are pointwise $\mu$-almost everywhere bounded by $G +g_n$, and that $\int _X g_n\ d\mu \to 0$ as $n\to \infty$. Show that 
$$\lim _{n\to \infty} \int _X f_n\ d\mu =\int _X f\ d\mu$$
