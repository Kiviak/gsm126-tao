Let $f:X\to [0,+\infty]$ be a simple function on a measure space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$, and suppose that there are disjoint measurable sets $E_1,\dots,E_m$ such that $f$ is supported on $E_1\cup \dots\cup E_m$ and equals $c_i$ on each $E_i$ for some $c_i\in [0,+\infty]$. Show that 
$$\text{Simp} \int _X f\ d\mu= \sum \limits _{j=1}^m c_j \mu(E_j)$$
