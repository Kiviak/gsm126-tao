Show that every finite Boolean algebra is an atomic algebra. (A Boolean algebra $\mathcal{B}$ is $finite$ if its cardinality is finite, i.e., there are only finitely many measurable sets.) Conclude that every finite Boolean algebra has a cardinality of the form $2^n$ for some natural number $n$. From this exercise and Exercise 1.4.3 we see that there is a one-to-one correspondence between finite Boolean algebras on $X$ and finite partitions of $X$ into non-empty set (up to relabeling).
