(Countable combinations of measures). Let $(X, \mathcal{B})$ be a measurable space.
1. If $\mu$ is a countably additive measure on $\mathcal{B}$, and $c \in [0, +\infty]$, then $c\mu$ is also countably additive.
2. If $\mu _1,\mu _2,\dots$ are a sequence of countably additive measures on $\mathcal{B}$, then the sum $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\mu _n :E \mapsto \sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\mu_n(E)$ is also a countably additive measure.
