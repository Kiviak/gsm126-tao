Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $g:X\to [0,+\infty]$ be measurable. Show that the function $\mu_g:\mathcal{B}\to [0,+\infty]$ defined by the formula 
$$\mu _g(E)\coloneqq \int _X 1_E g\ d\mu=\int _E g\ d\mu$$ 
is a measure. (Such measures are studied in greater detail in $\S1.2$ of $An\ epsilon\ of\ room,\ \text{Vol}.\ I$.)
