Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a finite Boolean algebra, generated by a finite family $A_1,\dots,A_k$ of non-empty atoms. Show that for every finitely additive measure $\mu$ on $\mathcal{B}$ there exists $c_1,\dots,c_k\in [0,+\infty]$ such that 
$$\mu(E)=\sum \limits _{1\le j \le k: A_j\sub E} c_j$$
Equivalently, if $x_j$ is a point in $A_j$ for each $1\le j \le k$, then 
$$\mu=\sum _{j=1}^k c_j \delta _{x_j}$$
Furthermore, show that the $c_1,\dots,c_k$ are uniquely determined by $\mu$.
