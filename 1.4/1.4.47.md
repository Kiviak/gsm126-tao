(Defect version of Fatou’s lemma). Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $f_1,f_2,\dots :X\to [0,+\infty]$ be a sequence of unsigned absolutely integrable functions that converges pointwise to an absolutely integrable limit $f$. Show that 
$$\int _X f_n\ d\mu -\int _X f\ d\mu -\lVert f-f_n\rVert _{L^1(\mu)} \to 0$$ 
as $n\to \infty$. Informally, this result (first established in [**BrLi1983**]) tells us that the gap between the left and right-hand sides of Fatou’s lemma can be measured by the quantity $\lVert f-f_n\rVert _{L^1(\mu)}$.
