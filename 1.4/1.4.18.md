Let $E$ be a Borel measurable subset of $\bold R^{d_1+d_2}$.
1. Show that for any $x_1\in \bold R^{d_1}$, the slice $\{x_2\in \bold R^{d_2}: (x_1,x_2)\in E\}$ is a Borel measurable subset of $\bold R^{d_2}$. Similarly, Show that for any $x_2\in \bold R^{d_2}$, the slice $\{x_1\in \bold R^{d_1}: (x_1,x_2)\in E\}$ is a Borel measurable subset of $\bold R^{d_1}$.
2. Give a counterexample to show that this claim is not true if $\text{\textquotedblleft Borel \textquotedblright}$ is replaced with $\text{\textquotedblleft Lebesgue \textquotedblright}$ throughout.
