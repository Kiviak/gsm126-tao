Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a finite measure space (i.e. $\mu(X)<\infty$), and let $f:X\to \bold R$ be a bounded function. Suppose that $\mu$ is complete (see Definition 1.4.31). Suppose that the upper integral
$$\overline {\int}_X f\ d\mu\coloneqq\inf \limits _{g\ge f;\ g\ \text{simple}} \int_X g\ d\mu$$
and lower integral
$$\underline {\int}_X f\ d\mu\coloneqq\sup \limits _{h\le f;\ h\ \text{simple}} \int_X h\ d\mu$$
agree. Show that $f$ is measurable. (This is a converse to Exercise 1.3.11.)
