(Borel-Cantelli lemma). Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, and let $E_1, E_2, E_3,\dots$ be a sequence of $\mathcal{B}$-measurable sets such that 
$$\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(E_n)<\infty$$ 
Show that almost every $x \in X$ is contained in at most finitely many of the $E_n$  (i.e. $\{n\in \bold N:x\in E_n\}$ is finite for almost every $x\in X$).
