Let $n$ be a natural number. Show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite collection of $n$ sets, then $\langle \mathcal{F} \rangle _{bool}$ is a finite Boolean algebra of cardinality at most $2^{2^n}$ (in particular, finite sets generate finite algebras). Give an example to show that this bound is best possible.
