(This exercise requires familiarity with the theory of cardinals.) Let $\mathcal{F}$ be an infinite family of subsets of $X$ of cardinality $\kappa$ (thus $\kappa$ is an infinite cardinal). Show that $\langle \mathcal{F} \rangle$ has cardinality at most $\kappa^{\alef_0}$. In particular, show that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}[\bold R^d]$ has cardinality at most $c\coloneqq 2^{\alef_0}$.
