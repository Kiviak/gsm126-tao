Let $(X, \mathcal{B})$ be a measurable space.
1. Show that a function $f : X \to [0, +\infty]$ is measurable if and only if the level sets $\lbrace x \in X : f(x) > \lambda \rbrace$ are $\mathcal{B}$-measurable.
2. Show that an indicator function $1_E$ of a set $E \sub X$ is measurable if and only if $E$ itself is $\mathcal{B}$-measurable.
3. Show that a function $f : X \to [0, +\infty]$ or $f : X \to  \bold C$ is measurable if and only if $f^{-1}(E)$ is $\mathcal{B}$-measurable for every Borel-measurable subset $E$ of $[0, +\infty]$ or $\bold C$.
4. Show that a function $f : X \to  \bold C$ is measurable if and only if its real and imaginary parts are measurable.
5. Show that a function $f : X \to  \bold R$ is measurable if and only if the magnitudes $f_+ \coloneqq \max(f, 0),\ f_\_ \coloneqq \max(-f, 0)$ of its positive and negative parts are measurable.
6. If $f_n : X \to [0, +\infty]$ are a sequence of measurable functions that converge pointwise to a limit $f : X \to [0, +\infty]$, then show that $f$ is also measurable. Obtain the same claim if $[0, +\infty]$ is replaced by $\bold C$.
7. If $f : X \to [0, +\infty]$ is measurable and $\phi : [0, +\infty] \to [0, +\infty]$ is continuous, show that $\phi \circ f$ is measurable. Obtain the same claim if $[0, +\infty]$ is replaced by $\bold C$.  
8. Show that the sum or product of two measurable functions in $[0, +\infty]$ or $\bold C$ is still measurable.
