(Dominated convergence for sets). Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $E_1,E_2,\dots$ be a sequence of $\mathcal{B}$-measurable sets that converge to another set $E$, in the sense that $1_{E_n}$ converges pointwise to $1_E$.
1. Show that $E$ is also $\mathcal{B}$-measurable.
2. If there exists a $\mathcal{B}$-measurable set $F$ of finite measure (i.e. $\mu(F)<\infty$) that contains all of the $E_n$, show that $\lim _{n\to\infty}\mu(E_n)=\mu(E)$.
3. Show that the previous part of this exercise can fail if the hypothesis that all the $E_n$ are contained in a set of finite measure is omitted.
