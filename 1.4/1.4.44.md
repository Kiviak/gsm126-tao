1. Give an alternate proof of the Borel-Cantelli lemma (Exercise 1.4.43) that does not go through any of the convergence theorems, but instead exploits the more basic properties of measure from Exercise 1.4.23.
2. Give a counterexample that shows that the Borel-Cantelli lemma can fail if the condition $\sum _{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n)<\infty$ is relaxed to $\lim _{n\to \infty} \mu(E_n)=0$.
