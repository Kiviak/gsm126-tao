Show that the Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}[\bold R^d]$ of a Euclidean set is generated by any of the following collections of sets:
1. The open subsets of $\bold R^d$.
2. The closed subsets of $\bold R^d$.
3. The compact subsets of $\bold R^d$.
4. The open balls of $\bold R^d$.
5. The boxes in $\bold R^d$.
6. The elementary sets in $\bold R^d$.
