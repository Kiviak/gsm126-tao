(Egorov's theorem). Let $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$ be a finite measure space (so $\mu(X)<\infty$), and let $f_n : X \to\bold C$ be a sequence of measurable functions that converge pointwise almost everywhere to a limit $f : X \to\bold C$, and let $\varepsilon>0$. Show that there exists a measurable set $E$ of measure at most $\varepsilon$ such that $f_n$ converges uniformly to $f$ outside of $E$. Give an example to show that the claim can fail when the measure $\mu$ is not finite.
