(Uniform convergence on a finite measure space). Suppose that $(X, \mathcal{B}, \mu)$ is a finite measure space (so $\mu(X) < \infty$), and $f_n : X \to [0, +\infty]$ (resp. $f_n :X \to \bold C$) are a sequence of unsigned measurable functions (resp. absolutely integrable functions) that converge uniformly to a limit $f$. Show that $\int _X f_n\ d\mu$ converges to $\int _X f\ d\mu$.
