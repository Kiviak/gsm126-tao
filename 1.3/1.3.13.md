(Area interpretation of integral). If $f:\bold R^d\to [0,+\infty]$ is measurable, show that $\int _{\bold R^d}f(x)\ dx$ is equal to the $d$+1-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the region $\{(x,t)\in \bold R^d \times \bold R :\ 0\le t\le f(x) \}$. (This can be used as an alternate, and more geometrically intuitive, definition of the unsigned Lebesgue integral; it is a more convenient formulation for establishing the basic convergence theorems, but not quite as convenient for establishing basic properties such as additivity.)
