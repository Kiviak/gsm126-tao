1. Show that every continuous function $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is measurable.
2. Show that a function $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is simple if and only if it is measurable and takes on at most finitely many values.
3. Show that a complex-valued function that is equal almost everywhere to an measurable function, is itself measurable.
4. Show that if a sequence $f_n$ of complex-valued measurable functions converges pointwise almost everywhere to an complex-valued limit $f$, then $f$ is also measurable.
5. If $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is measurable and $\phi:\bold C\to \bold C$ is continuous, show that $\phi\circ f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is measurable.
6. If $f,g$ are measurable functions, show that $f+g$ and $fg$ are measurable.
