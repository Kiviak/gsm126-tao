1. Show that every continuous function $f :\bold R^d \to [0, +\infty]$ is measurable.
2. Show that every unsigned simple function is measurable.
3. Show that the supremum, infimum, limit superior, or limit inferior of unsigned measurable functions is unsigned measurable.
4. Show that an unsigned function that is equal almost everywhere to an unsigned measurable function, is itself measurable.
5. Show that if a sequence $f_n$ of unsigned measurable functions converges pointwise almost everywhere to an unsigned limit $f$, then $f$ is also measurable.
6. If $f :\bold R^d \to [0, +\infty]$ is measurable and $\phi: [0, +\infty]\to [0, +\infty]$ is continuous, show that $\phi\circ f :\bold R^d \to [0, +\infty]$ is measurable.
7. If $f,g$ are unsigned measurable functions, show that $f + g$ and $fg$ are measurable.
