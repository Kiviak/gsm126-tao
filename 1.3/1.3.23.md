Show that the hypothesis that $f$ is absolutely integrable in Lusinâ€™s theorem can be relaxed to being locally absolutely integrable (i.e. absolutely integrable on every bounded set), and then relaxed further to that of being measurable (but still finite everywhere or almost everywhere). (To achieve the latter goal, one can replace $f$ locally with a horizontal truncation $f1_{|f|\le n}$; alternatively, one can replace $f$ with a bounded variant, such as $\frac{f}{(1+|f|^2)^{1/2}}$.)
