Let $f : \bold R^d \to [0, +\infty]$ be measurable, bounded, and vanishing outside of a set of finite measure. Show that the lower and upper Lebesgue integrals of $f$ agree. There is a converse to this statement, but we will defer it to later notes. What happens if $f$ is allowed to be unbounded, or is not supported inside a set of finite measure?
