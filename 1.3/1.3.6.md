Let $f:\bold R^d\to [0,+\infty]$ be an unsigned measurable function. Show that the region $\{(x,t)\in \bold R^d\times \bold R:\ 0\le t\le f(x)\}$ is a measurable subset of $\bold R^{d+1}$. (There is a converse to this statement, but we will wait until Exercise 1.7.24 to prove it, once we have the Fubini-Tonelli theorem(Corollary 1.7.23) available to us.)
