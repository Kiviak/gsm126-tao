(Integration is linear). Show that the integration $f \mapsto \int _{\bold R^d} f(x)\ dx$ is a (complex) linear operation from $L^1(\bold R^d)$ to $\bold C$. In other words, show that 
$$\int _{\bold R^d} f(x)+g(x)\ dx=\int _{\bold R^d} f(x)\ dx+\int _{\bold R^d} g(x)\ dx$$
and
$$\int _{\bold R^d} cf(x)\ dx=c\int _{\bold R^d} f(x)\ dx$$
for all absolutely integrable $f,g : \bold R^d \to \bold C$ and real numbers $c$. Also,establish the identity $$\int _{\bold R^d} \overline {f(x)}\ dx= \overline {\int _{\bold R^d} f(x)\ dx}$$ which makes integration not just a linear operation, but a *-$linear$ operation.
