(Absolute summability is a special case of absolute integrability). Let $(c_n)_{n\in\bold Z}$ be a doubly infinite sequence of complex numbers, and let $f:\bold R\to \bold C$ be the function
$$f(x)\coloneqq \sum \limits _{n\in\bold Z}c_n1_{[n,n+1)}(x)=c_{\lfloor x \rfloor}$$
where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than $x$. Show that $f$ is absolutely integrable if and only if the series $\sum _{n\in\bold Z}c_n$ is absolutely convergent, in which case one has $\int _{\bold R} f(x)\ dx=\sum _{n\in\bold Z}c_n$.
