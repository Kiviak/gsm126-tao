(Littlewood-like principles). The following facts are not, strictly speaking, instances of any of Littlewood's three principles, but are in a similar spirit.
1. (Absolutely integrable functions almost have bounded support) Let $f : \bold R^d \to \bold C$ be an absolutely integrable function, and let $\varepsilon > 0$. Show that there exists a ball $B(0, R)$ outside of which $f$ has an $L^1$ norm of at most $\varepsilon$, or in other words, that $\int _{\bold R^d\backslash B(0,R)} |f(x)|\ dx \le \varepsilon$.
2. (Measurable functions are almost locally bounded) Let $f : \bold R^d \to \bold C$ be a measurable function, and let $\varepsilon > 0$. Show that there exists a measurable set $E \sub\bold R^d$ of measure at most $\varepsilon$ outside of which $f$ is locally bounded, or in other words, that for every $R > 0$ there exists $M < \infty$ such that $|f(x)| \le M$ for all $x \in B(0, R)\backslash E$.
