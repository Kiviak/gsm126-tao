Let $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ be an almost everywhere defined complex-valued function. Then the following are equivalent:
1. $f$ is measurable.
2. $f$ is the pointwise almost everywhere limit of complex-valued simple functions.
3. The (magnitudes of the) positive and negative parts of $\text{Re}(f)$ and $\text{Im}(f)$ are unsigned measurable functions.
4. $f^{-1}(U)$ is Lebesgue measurable for every open set $U\sub \bold C$.
5. $f^{-1}(K)$ is Lebesgue measurable for every closed set $K\sub \bold C$.
