Let $f : \bold R^d \to [0, +\infty]$ be measurable.
1. Show that if $\int _{\bold R^d}f(x)\ dx < +\infty$, then $f$ is finite almost everywhere. Give a counterexample to show that the converse statement is false.
2. Show that $\int _{\bold R^d}f(x)\ dx =0$ if and only if $f$ is zero almost everywhere.
