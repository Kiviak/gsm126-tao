Show that a function $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is measurable if and only if it is the pointwise almost everywhere limit of continuous functions $f_n:\bold R^d\to \bold C$. (Hint: If $f:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ is measurable and $n\ge1$, show that there exists a continuous function $f_n:\bold R^d\to \bold C$ for which the set $\{x\in B(0,n):\ |f(x)-f_n(x)|\ge 1/n\}$ has measure at most $\frac{1}{2^n}$. You may find Exercise 1.3.25 below to be useful for this.) Use this (and Egorov’s theorem, Theorem 1.3.26) to give an alternate proof of Lusin’s theorem for arbitrary measurable functions.
