Let $d,d'\ge 1$ be natural numbers.
1. If $E\sub\bold R^d$ and $F\sub\bold R^{d'}$, show that $$(m^{d+d'})^*(E\times F)\le (m^{d})^*(E)(m^{d'})^*(F)$$
where $(m^d)^*$ denotes $d$-dimensional Lebesgue measure, etc.
2. Let $E\sub\bold R^d$, $F\sub\bold R^{d'}$ be Lebesgue measurable sets. Show that $E\times F\sub \bold R^{d+d'}$ is Lebesgue measurable, with $m^{d+d'}(E\times F)= m^{d}(E)\cdot m^{d'}(F)$. (Note that we allow $E$ or $F$ to have infinite measure, and so one may have to divide into cases or take advantage of the monotone convergence theorem for Lebesgue measure, Exercise 1.2.11.)
