(This exercise presumes some familiarity with point-set topology.) Show that the half-open interval $[0,1)$ cannot be expressed as the
countable union of disjoint closed intervals. (Hint: It is easy to prevent $[0,1)$ from being expressed as the finite union of disjoint closed intervals. Next, assume for the sake of contradiction that $[0,1)$ is the union of infinitely many closed intervals, and conclude that $[0,1)$ is homeomorphic to the middle thirds Cantor set, which is absurd. It is also possible to proceed using the $Baire\ category\ theorem$ ($\S 1.7$ of $An\ epsilon\ of\ room,\ \text{Vol. I}$.) For an additional challenge, show that $[0,1)$ cannot be expressed as the countable union of disjoint closed sets.
