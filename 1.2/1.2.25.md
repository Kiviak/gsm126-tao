Define a $continuously\ differentiable\ curve$ in $\bold R^d$ to be a set of the form $\{\gamma(t):a\le t\le b\}$ where $[a,b]$ is a closed interval and $\gamma:[a,b]\to\bold R^d$ is a continuously differentiable function.
1. If $d\ge 2$, show that every continuously differentiable curve has Lebesgue measure zero. (Why is the condition $d\ge 2$ necessary?)
2. Conclude that if $d\ge 2$, then the unit cube $[0, 1]^d$ cannot be covered by countably many continuously differentiable curves.
