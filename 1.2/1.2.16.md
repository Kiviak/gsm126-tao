(Criteria for finite measure). Let $E \sub \bold R^d$. Show that the following are equivalent:
1. $E$ is Lebesgue measurable with finite measure.
2. (Outer approximation by open) For every $\varepsilon > 0$, one can contain $E$ in an open set $U$ of finite measure with $m^*(U\backslash E) \le \varepsilon$.
3. (Almost open bounded) $E$ differs from a bounded open set by a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue outer measure. (In other words, for every $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists a bounded open set $U$ such that $m^*(U\Delta E) \le \varepsilon$.)
4. (Inner approximation by compact) For every  $\varepsilon > 0$, one can find a compact set $F$ contained in $E$ with $m^*(E\backslash F) \le \varepsilon$.
5. (Almost compact) $E$ differs from a compact set by a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue outer measure.
6. (Almost bounded measurable) $E$ differs from a bounded Lebesgue measurable set by a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue outer measure.
7. (Almost finite measure) $E$ differs from a Lebesgue measurable set with finite measure by a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue outer measure.
8. (Almost elementary) $E$ differs from an elementary set by a set of arbitrarily small Lebesgue outer measure.
9. (Almost dyadically elementary) For every $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an integer $n$ and a finite union $F$ of closed dyadic cubes of sidelength
$2^{-n}$ such that $m^*(E\Delta F) \le \varepsilon$.
