(Change of variables). If $E\sub\bold R^d$ is Lebesgue measurable, and $T:\bold R^d\to \bold R^d$ is a linear transformation, show that $T(E)$ is Lebesgue measurable, and that $m(T(E))=|\det T|m(E)$. We caution that if $T:\bold R^d\to \bold R^{d'}$ is a linear map to a space $\bold R^{d'}$ of strictly smaller dimension than $\bold R^d$, then $T(E)$ need not be Lebesgue measurable; see Exercise 1.2.27.
