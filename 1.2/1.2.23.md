(Uniqueness of Lebesgue measure). Show that Lebesgue measure $E\mapsto m(E)$ is the only map from Lebesgue measurable sets to $[0,+\infty]$ that obeys the following axioms:
1. (Empty set) $m(\empty)=0$.
2. (Countable additivity) If $E_1,E_2,\dots \sub \bold R^d$ is a countable sequence of disjoint Lebesgue measurable sets, then $m(\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}m(E_n)$.
3. (Translation invariance) If $E$ is Lebesgue measurable and $x\in \bold R^d$, then $m(E+x)=m(E)$.
4. (Normalisation) $m([0, 1]^d)=1$.
