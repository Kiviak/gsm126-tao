We say that a sequence $E_n$ of sets in $\bold R^d$ $converges\ pointwise$ to another set $E$ in $\bold R^d$ if the $indicator\ functions$ $1_{E_n}$ converge pointwise to $1_E$.
1. Show that if the $E_n$ are all Lebesgue measurable, and converge pointwise to $E$, then $E$ is Lebesgue measurable also.
2. (Dominated convergence theorem) Let $E_n$, $E$ be as in part $1$, suppose that the $E_n$ are all contained in another Lebesgue measurable set $F$ of finite measure. Show that $m(E_n)$ converges to $m(E)$.
3. Give a counterexample to show that the dominated convergence theorem fails if the $E_n$ are not contained in a set of finite measure, even if we assume that the $m(E_n)$ are all uniformly bounded.
