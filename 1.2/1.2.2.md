Give an example of a sequence of uniformly bounded, Riemann integrable functions $f_n : [0,1] \to \bold R$ for $n = 1, 2,\cdots$ that converge pointwise to a bounded function $f : [0,1] \to \bold R$ that is not Riemann integrable. What happens if we replace pointwise convergence with uniform convergence?
