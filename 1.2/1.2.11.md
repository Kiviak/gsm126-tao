(Monotone convergence theorem for measurable sets).
1. (Upward monotone convergence) Let $E_1\sub E_2\sub\dots\sub\bold R^d$ be a countable non-decreasing sequence of Lebesgue measurable sets.
Show that $m(\bigcup _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n)=\lim _{n\to\infty}m(E_n)$.
2. (Downward monotone convergence) Let $\bold R^d\supset E_1\supset E_2\supset\dots$ be a countable non-increasing sequence of Lebesgue measurable sets. If at least one of the $m(E_n)$ is finite, show that $m(\bigcap _{n=1}^{\infty}E_n)=\lim _{n\to\infty}m(E_n)$.
3. Give a counterexample to show that in the hypothesis that at least one of the $m(E_n)$ is finite in the downward monotone convergence theorem cannot be dropped.
