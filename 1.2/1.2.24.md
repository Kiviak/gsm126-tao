(Lebesgue measure as the completion of elementary measure). The purpose of the following exercise is to indicate how Lebesgue measure can be viewed as a metric completion of elementary measure in some sense. To avoid some technicalities we will not work in all of $\bold R^d$, but in some fixed elementary set $A$ (e.g. $A=[0,1]^d$).
1. Let $2^A\coloneqq \{E:E\sub A\}$ be the power set of $A$. We say that two sets $E,F\in 2^A$ are $equivalent$ if $E\Delta F$ is a null set. Show that this is a equivalence relation.
2. Let $2^A/\sim$ be the set of equivalence classes $[E]\coloneqq \{F\in 2^A: E\sim F\}$ of $2^A$ with respect to the above equivalence relation. Define a distance between two equivalence classes $[E],[E']$ by defining $d([E],[E'])\coloneqq m^*(E\Delta E')$. Show that this
distance is well defined (in the sense that $m(E\Delta E')=m(F\Delta F')$ whenever $[E]= [F]$ and $[E']= [F']$) and gives $2^A/\sim$ the structure of a complete metric space.
3. Let $\large{\varepsilon}$ $\sub 2^A$ be the elementary subsets of $A$, and let $\mathcal{L}\sub 2^A$ be the Lebesgue measurable subsets of $A$. Show that $\mathcal{L}/\sim$ is the closure of $\large{\varepsilon}$ $/\sim$ with respect to the metric defined above. In particular, $\mathcal{L}/\sim$ is a complete metric space that contains $\large{\varepsilon}$ $/\sim$ as a dense subset; in other words, $\mathcal{L}/\sim$ is a metric completion of $\large{\varepsilon}$ $/\sim$.
4. Show that Lebesgue measure $m:\mathcal{L} \to \bold R^+$ descends to a continuous function $m:\mathcal{L}/\sim \to \bold R^+$, which by abuse of notation we shall still call $m$. Show that $m:\mathcal{L}/\sim \to \bold R^+$ is the unique continuous extension of the analogous elementary measure function $m:\large{\varepsilon}$ $/\sim$ $\to \bold R^+$ to $\mathcal{L}/\sim$.
