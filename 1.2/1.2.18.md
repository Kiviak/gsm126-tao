(Inner measure). Let $E\sub\bold R^d$ be a bounded set. Define the $Lebesgue\ inner\ measure\ m_*(E)$ of $E$ by the formula $$m_*(E)\coloneqq m(A)-m^*(A\backslash E)$$ for any elementary set $A$ containing $E$.
1. Show that this definition is well defined, i.e., that if $A,A'$ are two elementary sets containing $E$, then $m(A)-m^*(A\backslash E)$ is equal to $m(A')-m^*(A'\backslash E)$.
2. Show that $m_*(E)\le m^*(E)$, and that equality holds if and only if $E$ is Lebesgue measurable.
