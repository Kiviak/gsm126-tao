(Criteria for measurability). Let $E\sub \bold R^d$. Show that the following are equivalent:
1. $E$ is Lebesgue measurable.
2. (Outer approximation by open) For every $\varepsilon>0$, one can contain $E$ in an open set $U$ with $m^*(U\backslash E)\le\varepsilon$.
3. (Almost open) For every $\varepsilon>0$, one can find an open set $U$ such that $m^*(U\Delta E)\le\varepsilon$. (In other words, $E$ differs from an open set by a set of outer measure at most $\varepsilon$.)
4. (Inner approximation by closed) For every $\varepsilon>0$, one can find a closed set $F$ contained in $E$ with $m^*(E\backslash F)\le\varepsilon$.
5. (Almost closed) For every $\varepsilon>0$, one can find a closed set $F$ such that $m^*(F\Delta E)\le \varepsilon$. (In other words, $E$ differs from a closed set by a set of outer measure at most $\varepsilon$.)
6. (Almost measurable) For every $\varepsilon>0$, one can find a Lebesgue measurable set $E_\varepsilon$ such that $m^*(E_\varepsilon\Delta E)\le \varepsilon$. (In other words, $E$ differs from a measurable set by a set of outer measure at most $\varepsilon$.)
