(Defect version of Fatouâ€™s lemma). Suppose that $f_n:X\to [0,+\infty)$ are measurable, are such that $\sup _n \int _X f_n\ d \mu< \infty$, and converge pointwise almost everywhere to some measurable limit $f:X\to [0,+\infty)$. Show that $f_n$ converges in $L^1$ norm to $f$ if and only if $\int _X f_n\ d \mu$ converges to $\int _X f\ d \mu$. Informally, we see that in the unsigned, bounded mass case, pointwise convergence implies $L^1$ norm convergence if and only if there is no loss of mass.
