Let $f_n: X\to\bold C$ be a sequence of measurable functions, and let $f: X\to\bold C$ be another measurable function. Show that the following are equivalent:
1. $f_n$ converges in measure to $f$.
2. Every subsequence $f_{n_j}$ of the $f_n$ has a further subsequence $f_{n_{j_i}}$ that converges almost uniformly to $f$.
