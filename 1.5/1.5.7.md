Let $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, let $f_n: X\to\bold C$ be a sequence of measurable functions converging pointwise almost everywhere as $n\to\infty$ a measurable limit $f: X\to\bold C$, and for each $n$, let $f_{n,m}: X\to\bold C$ be a sequence of measurable functions converging pointwise almost everywhere as $m\to\infty$ (keeping $n$ fixed) to $f_n$.
1. If $\mu(X)$ is finite, show that there exists a sequence $m_1,m_2,\dots$ such that $f_{n,m_n}$ converges pointwise almost everywhere to $f$.
2. Show the same claim is true if, instead of assuming that $\mu(X)$ is finite, we merely assume that $X$ is $\sigma$-finite, i.e., it is the countable union of sets of finite measure.
