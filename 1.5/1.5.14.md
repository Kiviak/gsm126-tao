This exercise is a partial converse to Exercise 1.5.13. Let $X$ be a probability space, and let $f_n: X\to\bold C$ be a sequence of absolutely integrable functions with $\sup _n \|f_n\| _{L^1}<\infty$. Suppose that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that 
$$\int _E |f_n(x)|\ d\mu\le \varepsilon$$
whenever $n\ge 1$ and $E$ is a measurable set with $\mu(E)\le \delta$.  Show that the sequence $f_n$ is uniformly integrable.
