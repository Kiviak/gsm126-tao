(Monotone convergence theorem). Suppose that $f_n:X\to [0,+\infty)$ are measurable, monotone non-decreasing in $n$ and are such that $\sup _n \int _X f_n\ d \mu< \infty$. Show that $f_n$ converges in $L^1$ norm to $\sup _n f_n$. (Note that $\sup _n f_n$ can be infinite on a null set, but the definition of $L^1$ convergence can be easily modified to accommodate this.)
