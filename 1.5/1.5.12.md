(Uniform $L^p$ bound on finite measure implies uniform integrability). Suppose that $X$ has finite measure, let $1 <p<\infty$, and suppose that $f_n : X \to\bold C$ is a sequence of measurable functions such that $\sup _n\int _{X} |f_n|^p\ d\mu<+\infty$. Show that the sequence $f_n$ is uniformly integrable.
