(Linearity of convergence). Let $(X, \mathcal{B},\mu)$ be a measure space, let $f_n, g_n : X \to \bold C$ be sequences of measurable functions, and let $f, g : X \to \bold C$ be measurable functions.
1. Show that $f_n$ converges to $f$ along one of the above seven modes of convergence if and only if $|f_n-f|$ converges to $0$ along the same mode.
2. If $f_n$ converges to $f$ along one of the above seven modes of convergence, and $g_n$ converges to $g$ along the same mode, show that $f_n+g_n$ converges to $f+g$ along the same mode, and that $cf_n$ converges to $cf$ along the same mode for any $c \in \bold C$.
3. (Squeeze test) If $f_n$ converges to $0$ along one of the above seven modes, and $|g_n| \le |f_n|$ pointwise for each $n$, show that $g_n$ converges to $0$ along the same mode.
