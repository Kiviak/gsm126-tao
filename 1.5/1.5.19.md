Let $X$ be a probability space (see Section 2.3). Given any real-valued measurable function $f:X\to \bold R$, we define the $cumulative\ distribution\ function\ F:\bold R\to [0,1]$ of $f$ to be the function $F(\lambda)\coloneqq \mu(\{x\in X:f(x)\le \lambda\})$. Given another sequence $f_n:X\to \bold R$ of real-valued measurable functions, we say that $f_n\ converges\ in\ distribution$ to $f$ if the cumulative distribution function $F_n(\lambda)$ of $f_n$ converges pointwise to the cumulative distribution function $F(\lambda)$ of $f$ at all $\lambda\in \bold R$ for which $F$ is continuous.
1. Show that if $f_n$ converges to $f$ in any of the seven senses discussed above (uniformly, essentially uniformly, almost uniformly pointwise, pointwise almost everywhere, in $L^1$, or in measure), then it converges in distribution to $f$.
2. Give an example in which $f_n$ converges to $f$ in distribution, but not in any of the above seven senses.
3. Show that convergence in distribution is not linear, in the sense that if $f_n$ converges to $f$ in distribution, and $g_n$ converges to $g$, then $f_n+g_n$ need not converge to $f+g$.
4. Show that a sequence $f_n$ can converge in distribution to two different limits $f,g$, which are not equal almost everywhere.
