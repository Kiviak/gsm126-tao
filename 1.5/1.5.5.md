(Fast $L^1$ convergence). Suppose that $f_n,f: X\to\bold C$ are measurable functions such that $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty}\|f_n-f\|_{L^1(\mu)}<\infty$; thus, not only do the quantities $\|f_n-f\|_{L^1(\mu)}$ go to zero (which would mean $L^1$ convergence), but they converge in an absolutely summable fashion.
1. Show that $f_n$ converges pointwise almost everywhere to $f$.
2. Show that $f_n$ converges almost uniformly to $f$.
